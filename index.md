# Welcome to Our Course!

This course is a free and open learning project in biological modeling at multiple scales.

That may seem like a mouthful. By "biological modeling" we mean that we are going to build simplified models of biological systems that provide us with some insight into how those systems really work on a fundamental level.

For example, have you ever wondered how your cells can react to their environment and perform complex tasks without any intelligence guiding them.  Have you ever wondered why zebras have stripes, or leopards have spots?  Have you ever wondered how we can train a computer to "see" objects lurking within a larger picture?

We will see how each of these questions touches on biological modeling.  Furthermore, we will see that modeling molecular and cellular biological systems is fruitful at multiple "scales" of resolution, from the study of a single protein molecule within a cell's cytoplasm, to observing the interaction of proteins molecules interacting with each other as a whole, to a much wider view that considers cells themselves interacting with each other.  There are fascinating insights lurking at all these levels of resolution, and the goal of this course is to .

## Getting Started

If you are ready to jump in and get started, please join us in the [Prologue](prologue).

## About the project

If you're interested in finding out more about this open project, read our [About](about) page.

## Meet the team

This course was lovingly put together by a professor and a team of students in Carnegie Mellon University's [Computational Biology Department](http://cbd.cmu.edu).  You can meet us on our [Team](meet-the-team) page.

## Contact

Whether you are a student who would like to provide us with a testimonial, or an instructor interested in adopting this material for your own courses, we would be happy to hear from you.  Please reach out to us on the [Contact](contact) page.
