Proteins are not static, but rather dynamic structures. These fluctuations in their structures are typically key components their functions. Molecular dynamics (MD) is all about simulating molecules to analyze the movement of the molecules, atoms, and their interactions. However, simulating large structures, such as proteins with hundreds of amino acids, can prove to be extremely computationally heavy. Fortunately, there is an alternative method of studying large-scale movements of these structures called Normal mode analysis (NMA). NMA of proteins is based on the theory that the lowest frequency vibrational normal modes are the most functionally relavent, describing the largest movement within the protein.

One of the approaches for modeling a molecule is to represent atoms as nodes that are interconnected with springs, otherwise known as an elastic network model (ENM). Gaussian network model (GNM) is the ENM for isotropic fluctions where only the fluctuation magnitudes are analyzed. The anisotropic counterpart is called anisotropic network model (ANM), where the direction of the fluctuations are also considered. GNM and ANM are both popular methods for performing NMA.

One of the main strengths of ProDy is its capabilities for protein dynamics analysis. This includes performing both GNM and ANM analysis, allowing users to generate contact maps, cross-correlations, slow mode shape, and square fluctuations plot. VMD contains a plugin called Normal Mode Wizard (NMWiz), which is designed as a GUI for ProDy and allows users to perform ProDy's NMA directly in VMD. In addition, ANM calculations can also be visualized to produce animations of the protein.

#### GNM Calculation of the Spike Protein

GNM Calculations were performed on SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/structure/6VXX" target="_blank">6vxx</a>) and SARS Spike protein (<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/structure/5xlr" target="_blank">5xlr</a>). Below are plots generated from the calculations. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the plots show very small differences between SARS-CoV-2 Spike and SARS spike proteins given that they are highly similar proteins in shape and function.

##### Contact Map
{: .no_toc}

A protein contact map is a 2D matrix that represents the distance between all amino acid residues in the protein. The pair is assigned the value of 1 if the two residues are closer together than a predetermined threshold distance, and 0 otherwise. The threshold for the maps below is 20 Ã….

##### Cross-Correlation
{: .no_toc}

Protein residue cross-correlation shows the correlation between the fluctuations/displacement of residues. The pair is assigned the value of 1 if the fluctuations are completely correlated, the value of -1 if the fluctuations are completely anticorrelated, and a value of 0 if uncorrelated. It is typical to see a diagonal of strong cross-correlation. Positive correlations coming off the diagonal represents correlations between contiguous residues and are characteristics of secondary structures. Common patterns for secondary structures are triangular structures for helices and plume structures for strands. Off-diagonal correlation and anticorrellations may potential represent interesting interactions between non-contiguous residues and domains.

##### Slow Mode Shape
{: .no_toc}

NMA is based on the idea that the lowest frequency modes describe the largest movement in the structure. Below is the plot of the lowest frequency (slowest) mode calculated by ProDy. Greater amplitudes represent regions of greater fluctuations.

##### Square Fluctuation

This is another representation of the slowest mode with the same interpretation. Greater amplitudes represent regions of greater fluctuations.

#### ANM Analysis and Animations Using NMWiz

NMWiz was designed as a GUI for ProDy and is available as a plugin for VMD. ANM calculations were performed using NMWiz on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD (<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/structure/6vw1" target="_blank">6vw1</a>) and SARS Spike RBD (<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/structure/2ajf" target="_blank">2ajf</a>). NMWiz is also able to generate cross-correlation and square fluctuation plots.

##### Animations
{: .no_toc}

Because ANM also takes direction into consideration, it is possible to create animations of the protein fluctuation. The following animations are of the binding ridge between the Spike RBD (purple) and ACE2 (green). Important residues from regions of conformational differences between the two RBD (from the previous page) are also colored. 

*It is important to note that fluctuation calculated by ANM provides information on possible movement and flexibility, but does not depict actual protein movements.*
