# Multiscale Biological Modeling Test Website

*Remember to use F5 as a hard refresh when looking to make rapid edits + previews* 
Strange refresh order: it seems certain elements do not update on Github Pages at same time. E.g.
  1. Edit text in file to say "Hi" + change navigation
  2. Wait a few minutes, refresh preview, see changed navigation but no text
  3. Edit text in file to say "Hi2"
  4. Wait a few minutes, refresh preview, see changed navigation and "Hi"

The home page is "/index.md"

To add a new page, add a file (html or markdown) to "_pages" update "_data/navigation.yml"
