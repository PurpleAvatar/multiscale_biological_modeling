## The world's fastest outbreak

On February 21, 2003, a Chinese doctor named Liu Jianlun flew to Hong Kong to attend a wedding and checked into Room 911 of the Metropole Hotel. The next day, he became too ill to attend the wedding and was admitted to a hospital. Two weeks later, Dr. Liu was dead.

On his deathbed, Liu told doctors that he had recently treated sick patients in Guangdong Province, China where a deadly, highly contagious respiratory illness had infected hundreds of people. The Chinese government had made brief mention of this incident to the World Health Organization but had concluded that the likely culprit was a common bacterial infection. By the time anyone realized the severity of the disease, it was already too late to stop the outbreak. On February 23, a man who had stayed across the hall from Dr. Liu at the Metropole traveled to Hanoi and died after infecting 80 people. On February 26, a woman checked out of the Metropole, traveled back to Toronto, and died after initiating an outbreak there. On March 1, a third guest was admitted to a hospital in Singapore, where sixteen additional cases of the illness arose within two weeks.[^3][^4].

Consider that it took four years for the Black Death, which killed over a third of all Europeans in the 14th Century, to travel from Constantinople to Kiev. Or that HIV took two decades to circle the globe. In contrast, this mysterious new disease had crossed the Pacific Ocean within a week of entering Hong Kong.

As health officials braced for the impact of the fastest-traveling virus in human history, panic set in. Businesses were closed, sick passengers were removed from airplanes, and Chinese officials threatened to execute infected patients who violated quarantine. In the process, the mysterious new disease earned a name: **Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome**, or **SARS**.

## Finding the source of the outbreak

SARS was deadly, killing close to 10% of those who became sick.[^cdc-factsheet] But it also struggled to spread much farther within the human population, and it was contained in July 2003 with fewer than 10,000 confirmed symptomatic cases worldwide.

Scientists initially thought that humans had contracted SARS from palm civets, which are native to Guangdong. But research would later show that the disease likely originated in bats, a notorious disease carrier.[^bats]

And in 2017, researchers published the result of five years of sampling horseshoe bats from a cave in Yunnan province. They found that the bats harbored coronaviruses with remarkable genetic similarity to SARS, and they hypothesized that the bats may have in fact derived from horseshoe bats. Yet their work is now famous because they identified viruses that were similar to SARS and capable of entering human cells. The following lines from their article are now chilling.[^bat-cave]

> We have also revealed that various SARSr-CoVs ... are still circulating among bats in this region. Thus, the risk of spillover into people and emergence of a disease similar to SARS is possible. This is particularly important given that the nearest village to the bat cave we surveyed is only 1.1 km away, which indicates a potential risk of exposure to bats for the local residents. Thus, we propose that monitoring of SARSr-CoV evolution at this and other sites should continue, as well as examination of human behavioral risk for infection and serological surveys of people, to determine if spillover is already occurring at these sites and to design intervention strategies to avoid future disease emergence.

This is not to say that the coronavirus went anywhere – point about 2017 paper

Then transition to SARS-2.

What could make the second virus so much deadlier than the first?  What are the differences between the viruses and how do these contribute to something that has become a much more infectious disease?

After all, the diseases are startlingly similar – show image of the two under microscope?  They are indistinguishable visually.

They even have the same mechanism of entering host cells – Spike glycoprotein.  Explain what it does.

Two objectives are great: first, we will put ourselves in the shoes of researchers working with the new virus in January 2020 and study the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  Second, we will perform a comparative analysis against the SARS—Cov-1 spike protein to determine what makes it more infectious.  This type of study is vital because if we can understand how it attacks our cells then we can start to defend against it.

“One of the world's most important warning systems for a deadly new outbreak is a doctor's or nurse's recognition that some new disease is emerging and then sounding the alarm”, said Tom Inglesby, the Director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, MD, USA. “It takes intelligence and courage to step up and say something like that, even in the best of circumstances.”

### The Onset of SARS

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS or SARS-CoV for coronvirus) made its first appearance in November 2002 Guangdong, China, where the first case of “atypical pneumonia” was reported [^1]. Near the end of the month, the Canadian Global Public Health Intelligence Network and US Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System, partners of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), picked up on media reports describing an “influenza outbreak” in Beijing and Guangzhou. The World Health Organization (WHO) requested information from Chinese Authorities and a report was received on 12 December. The details described an investigation of 23 influenza virus isolates, 22 of which confirmed to be type B strains, and how the number of cases were like that of past seasonal patterns. By 11 February 2003, an official report of a severe respiratory syndrome/atypical pneumonia with more than 300 cases and five deaths was received by the WHO by the Chinese Ministry of Health. The WHO Global Influenza Network was alerted by the potential of a presumed new strain of influenza. When Hong Kong authorities reported two cases of A(H5N1) avian influenza on 20 February, WHO influenza pandemic preparedness plans were activated [^2].


By the middle of March, WHO has received more than 150 new cases in Canada and six Asian countries, and on 15 March, WHO issues an emergency travel advisory global alert along with the disease name SARS. During the containment phase, GOARN recruited laboratory scientists, clinicians, and epidemiologists to provide real-time information, allowing the WHO to provide specific guidance to prevent further spread. Airports began screening individuals for any history of contact with individuals showing SARS-like symptoms to prevent international spread. Eventually, the passengers were asked to avoid traveling to any areas where contact tracing could not link all the cases to known chains of transmission. By 5 July 2003, the SARS outbreak was officially declared to be contained, but not before affecting around 27 countries with 8098 total cases and 774 deaths worldwide [^2][^5]. Later studies identified coronavirus in Chinese horseshoe bats, and in 2017, a population of horseshoe bats in Yunnan province was found to harbor virus strains with all the necessary genetic building blocks to transmit to humans [^6].

### The COVID-19 Pandemic

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the 2019-2020 COVID-19 pandemic that is believed to have started in Wuhan, China. Although not confirmed, it is believed that the first case dates to 17 November 2019 [^7]. On 31 December 2019, the WHO received reports regarding numerous cases of pneumonia of an undetermined cause from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. The next day, the WHO activates the three-level Incident Management Support Team to assess the new disease. The disease spread extremely quickly throughout the city where cases doubled every 7.4 days [^8]. By the end of January, 7818 cases were confirmed across 19 countries, resulting in the WHO declaring the sixth Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [^9][^10].

The very next day, Russia, Italy, and United Kingdom reported their first cases of COVID-19 and joined the list affected countries. From then on, the number of COVID-19 cases has exploded, spreading to around 213 countries and territories across the globe as of 17 August 2020.

### Why were they so different?

Just by looking at the name SARS-CoV-2, one can assume that this virus is related to SARS-CoV from 2003. In fact, both viruses belong to the broad coronavirus family, with SARS-CoV-2 being the seventh identified coronavirus to be able to infect humans. So how come the outbreak of SARS and COVID-19 are so different?

Of course, each outbreak is never handled in the exact same way, and differences in both time and approach by authorities will impact the spread of the disease. However, biological differences between the viruses are also key aspects. At the highest level, the most common symptoms between the two are very similar: fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath. However, SARS tends to be more severe, with 20-30% of cases requiring mechanical ventilation while an estimated 20% of COVID-19 cases requiring ventilation [^11][^12]. In addition, a key difference in symptoms and transmission is that SARS-CoV-2 can be spread by individuals that are asymptomatic [^13]. In contrast, there are no known cases of SARS from exposure to a SARS patient who has not developed symptoms yet [^14]. This most likely played a major role in international transmission and the attributes to the difficulty in containing the disease.

Investigating the biology of the viruses may also reveal key factors in the outbreak difference. SARS and SARS-CoV-2 viruses belong to the genus Betacoronavirus lineage B. On the whole-genome level, SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to bat coronaviruses, RaTG13, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC2 with a sequence identity of 96%, 87.99% and 87.23%, respectively, and less genetically similar to SARS-CoV with a sequence identity of about 79% [^15]. However, the method of infection between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are strikingly similar. The surface of the viruses is decorated with a transmembrane protein called the Spike protein (S protein). The S protein is critical in the recognition and viral entry into human host cells by binding to the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) on the host cell surface [^16][^17]. Because of the role the S protein plays, it has become one of the targets in developing a vaccine.

Even though the S proteins of the two viruses have the same general function, there are still notable differences between the two. Careful analysis of the S protein revealed that the receptor binding domain (RBD), the part of the S protein that directly interacts with ACE2, of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 with greater affinity [^18]. In addition, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be only 75% homologous to the SARS-CoV S protein [^19]. The differences between the two S proteins may reveal why SARS-CoV-2 is much more infectious than SARS.

There are two main objectives for this module. First, we will explore publicly available structure prediction software to model the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and then assess their accuracy. Second, we will visualize and perform comparative analysis on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and SARS-CoV S protein. All the analysis will be done using two software: ProDy and VMD. By the end of this module, you will be able to understand more about protein structure prediction and differences in the S proteins that attribute to the higher infectivity of COVID-19.
