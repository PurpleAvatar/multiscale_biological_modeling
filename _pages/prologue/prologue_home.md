*Introduction*

* We know from quantum physics that everything that happens in the universe is as a result of the interactions of particles, and that much of the movement of these particles boils down to randomness.
* It is difficult for “macro”-oriented beings like ourselves to even acknowledge that every hope we have ever had, every decision we have ever made, is the result of firings of neurons and the exchange of ions deep within us.
* So, although this is a course in biological modeling, much will revolve around our ability to make conclusions about large-scale things that we observe as a result of the complicated symphony of particles that are interacting randomly.
* It shouldn’t be a surprise that randomness is useful for drawing big-picture conclusions to those who have a background with computer programming.
* For example, whether we are forecasting an election from polling data, predicting the weather tomorrow, or simulating moves of stock prices to determine derivative prices – all of these require us to embrace the effects of randomness to determine average-case behavior.
