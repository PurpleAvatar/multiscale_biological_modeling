## Welcome to our course!

Have you ever wondered how your cells can react to their environment and perform complex tasks without any intelligence guiding them? Have you ever wondered what process causes zebras to have stripes?  Have you wondered why the original SARS coronavirus did not become a pandemic in 2003 but SARS-CoV-2 has spread like wildfire through the population?

We will see how each of these questions can be answered by biological modeling.

Welcome to our free and open course in multiscale biological modeling.

That may seem like a mouthful. By "biological modeling" we mean that we are going to build  models of biological systems that are relatively simple but nevertheless provide us with some deep insights into how those systems operate.

Furthermore, we will perform modeling of molecular and cellular biological systems at multiple "scales" of resolution, from the study of a single protein molecule within a cell's cytoplasm, to observing the interaction of proteins molecules interacting with each other as a whole, to a much wider view that considers cells themselves interacting with each other.  There are fascinating insights lurking at all these levels of resolution, and the goal of this course is to help learners understand some approaches that lead us to these insights.

## Meet the team

This course was lovingly put together by a professor and a team of students in Carnegie Mellon University's [Computational Biology Department](http://cbd.cmu.edu).  You can meet us on our [Meet the Team](meet-the-team) page.

## Contact

Whether you are a student who would like to provide us with a testimonial, or an instructor interested in adopting this material for your own courses, we would be happy to hear from you.  Please reach out to us on the [Contact](contact) page.

## Current offline projects

## Course survey and testimonials

* If you are a learner who enjoyed this course, we would love to hear from you.

* The first way is through a survey (use the Google form from P4L as a template.)

* The second way is through writing us a testimonial -- use the contact form to get in touch!

## For instructors

* Offline dissemination. Point that it is part of the materials for PreCollege program in computational biology.

If you are an instructor who is interested in adopting any or all of these materials in your teaching, please feel free to do so! We only ask you to:

1. Make sure to refer your students to our website.
2. Get in touch with us using our [Contact](contact) form so that we can add you to our list of adopting instructors and provide you with updates about the project in the future. We plan to build a community of instructors adopting this course.

## Other

* Synergies with MMBioS projects so that users of one software resource can become familiar with other resources

* Pointer to workshops that MMBioS offers -- URL: https://mmbios.pitt.edu/outreach/workshops

* Pointer to MMBioS in general with logo of MMBioS -- URL: https://mmbios.pitt.edu

* Overview of what each software resource does.

* Need to explain how each of the user groups below can explore the course.  Everything from reading only the written part to getting hands dirty with a collection of in-depth software tutorials that get you comfortable with learning how the software resources presented here can be used to model biological phenomena (preparing users to be ready to apply it in their own work).

* Our target audience is broadly defined into three categories. We do not see these three user communities as non-contiguous.

1. The first category contains **casual users** who are simply curious, “What is this biological modeling at multiple scales all about?”
2. The second category contains **hands-on users** who are interested in trying out and exploring biological modeling software produced by MMBioS and learning how this software exemplifies key principles of biological modeling.
3. The third category contains **dedicated users** who have a large toolset in biological modeling and can think independently within the field.

* Plan to allow students to transition between these areas.
