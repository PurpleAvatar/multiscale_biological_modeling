### Introduction
Proteins are one of the most important groups of macromolecules in living organisms, contributing to essentially all functions within them. At the most basic level, proteins differ from each other by its amino acid sequence. However, it is how the amino acids fold into a three-dimensional structure and its dynamics that determines protein function. In fact, small perturbations in the structure can have a large impact on the protein’s functionality, even to the point of rendering the protein completely nonfunctional. As biotechnology advanced, many protein analysis techniques, such as x-ray crystallography, have been developed that allows researchers to accurately determine protein structures. However, even such techniques have limitations, such as accessibility and costs. The goal of this module is to explore publicly available protein-prediction softwares and show how to use ProDy and VMD to analyze and visualize the generated protein models’ structure and dynamics. To make things more interesting, the focus will be on the Spike protein of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.

### ProDy
[ProDy](http://prody.csb.pitt.edu/) is an open-source Python package that allows users to perform protein structural dynamics analysis. Its flexibility allows users to select specific parts or atoms of the structure for conducting normal mode analysis and structure comparison.

### VMD
[VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) (Visual Molecular Dynamics) is a program that is designed for modeling of molecules and macromolecules. Many plugins are available for in-depth analysis, including molecular dynamics simulations and interaction energy analysis. NMWiz (normal mode wizard), which was designed as a GUI for ProDy, is included within VMD, allowing for visualization of analysis using ProDy.
