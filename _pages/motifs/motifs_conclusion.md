## Learning objectives

1. What are motifs?
2. How does the common motif "negative autoregulation" work?
3. How can the motif "feed forward loop" change a cellular response?
4. How can a cell achieve oscillatory behaviors and how robust is this process?

* We also need a note at end of chapter about the fact that the cell is growing so that in more robust models the concentration is constantly decreasing as a result of the cell growing since it needs to double its volume every cell cycle.

## Exercises

1. Modify the Jupyter notebook provided in the [tutorial on loops](tutorial_loops) to count the number of feed-forward loops in the transcription factor network for *E. coli.*

2. How many feedforward loops that you found in the preceding exercise are incoherent type-1 feed-forward loops?

3. (Challenge exercise) How many feed-forward loops would you expect to see in a random network having the same number of nodes as the *E. coli* transcription factor network? How does this compare to your answers to the previous two questions?
