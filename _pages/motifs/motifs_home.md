# (Something about scale of interest)

* Discussion of the scale that we are interested in now -- a very fine-grained scale involving the interaction between proteins and genes.

* Biological networks and extending our particle simulators to answer questions about "why" and "how" unintelligent systems can build nontrivial systems.

# Introduction to transcription

* Need to have an introduction to the biological process of transcription.  Disclaimer that learners with an in-depth knowledge of biology should skim it to the following section.

* As part of this discussion, mention how transcription factors serve as master regulators turning up or down the expression of a gene.

* These transcription factors are critical because they can help the cell respond to an external stimulus in which the transcription factor is activated by a chemical reaction taking place on the surface of the cell.  We will say more about this type of signal transduction process in a future chapter.

# Transcription factor networks

* Production of a network from transcription factors and proteins.  This will help us visualize relationships as well as look for patterns.

* Let's look at a subset of a TF network for *E. coli.*  This is just one example of a biological network.  (GIVE OTHERS: neural network, protein-protein interaction network)

* (WHAT ARE THE STATISTICS FOR THIS NETWORK)

* STOP: What do you see?

* What is clear is that we need some automated analysis of the network rather than relying on our own eyes due to the scale of the network.

* What our eyes do see is a lot of loops in which a transcription factor is connected to itself.

* There are two questions. One, is this anything out of the ordinary? And two, if that is true, why in the world would a transcription factor control its own regulation?

* In the next section, we will begin our analysis with a discussion of the first question.

## Separator

* Note to self: we don't have anything about the active form of a transcription factor. Technically it is this active form that we want to work with.

## Learning objectives -- MOVE THESE

*Here are some learning motivators/outline of content*
1. What are motifs?
2. How does the common motif "negative autoregulation" work?
3. How can the motif "feed forward loop" change a cellular response?
4. How can a cell achieve oscillatory behaviors and how robust is this process?
