## Turing and his machines

Our story will begin with the unlikeliest of major characters: Alan Turing. You may have heard of Turing, in which case you might be surprised as to why he would appear in a course on biological modeling.

INSERT PHOTO OF TURING

Turing is typically known for two contributions. First, he was a genius code breaker during WWII, helping to break several German ciphers. Second, his famous contribution to science came in a 1936 paper in which he introduced what has come to be known as a **Turing machine**. This hypothetical computer, which Turing introduced in 1935, reads numbers off of an infinitely long tape, moving up and down the tape, rewriting cells according to a finite collection of internal rules. What is remarkable about Turing machines is that nearly a century later, any task that a computer performs, from the device you are using to read this to the world's most powerful supercomputer, can still be implemented by a Turing machine.

You may be shocked that any computer can ultimately be represented by such a simple machine, one that Joseph Weizenbaum famously called nothing more than "pebbles on toilet paper". If this topic interests you, we include an excellent introductory video on Turing machines below.

Why spend time mentioning Turing's foundational work on theoretical computer science because what Turing was ultimately doing was demonstrating that the very simple rules of a Turing machine could be extended to obtain emergent behavior that seems far more complex. This is inherently tied to the point that we made in the introduction about the universe being governed by simple interactions of particles, a point that we now return to in the context of biological modeling.

## Turing the biochemist

Two years before his untimely demise in 1954, Turing published his only paper biochemistry. This paper centered on a very “macro” biological question: “Why do zebras have stripes?”

To be more precise, Turing was not approaching this question from the perspective of why zebras have evolved to have stripes --- this was unsolved in Turing's time, and recent research has indicated that the stripes may be helpful in warding off flies. Rather, Turing acknowledged that there must be some unintelligent system of molecular interactions that cause the "macro" stripes to appear on a zebra's coat, and he wanted to find a potential explanation for what this system might be.

In what follows, we will introduce a simple particle model based on Turing's ideas, explore how it can be tweaked to explain not just the appearance of stripes on an animal's skin but also spots, and explore the model's extensions to additional biological phenomena. Read on to join us!
