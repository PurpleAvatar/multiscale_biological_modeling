        <p markdown="1"> [Phillip Compeau](http://compeau.cbd.cmu.edu) is an Associate Teaching Professor and the Assistant Department Head for Education in the [Computational Biology Department](http://cbd.cmu.edu) in Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science. He directs the [undergraduate program in computational biology](http://www.cbd.cmu.edu/education/bs-in-computational-biology/), co-directs the [Precollege Program in Computational Biology](http://www.cbd.cmu.edu/education/pre-college-program-in-computational-biology/), and serves as [ssistant Director of the [Master's in Computational Biology program](http://www.cmu.edu/ms-compbio/).

Phillip is passionate about open online education, and his education projects have reached hundreds of thousands of learners around the world. He is the co-author of [Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active Learning Approach](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.org), which has been adopted in over 140 institutions around the world. This textbook powers the popular [Bioinformatics Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics). He co-founded the learning platform [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info) for learning programming, bioinformatics, and algorithms through independent problem solving.  Finally, Phillip is the founder of [Programming for Lovers](http://compeau.cbd.cmu.edu/programming-for-lovers/), an online course in introductory programming motivated by fun scientific applications.</p>
