## Setting up Module 1

*Will be using CellBlender*

### Setting up CellBlender 
Setting up CellBlender can be done using the default tutorial with just a few changes from the original installation instructions.

Follow the instructions from the [CellBlender website] (https://mcell.org/downloads/windows/install_2019_05/index.html)

**Watch out!** CellBlender is based on a legacy version of Blender. Use the following two changes to the default installation instructions. 
{: .notice--primary}

1. Instead of downloading the newest version of Blender, go to the previous versions tab...

...and download Blender 2.79b

2. Once Blender is downloaded,  the file path may be different from what is shown in the CellBlender tutorial- instead of *Blender/2.79/python/bin*, the pathway may be something like: *blender-2.79/2.79/python/bin*. Changing the name of the downloaded Blender folder to match the path in the tutorial may help reduce confusion.
