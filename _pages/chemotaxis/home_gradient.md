## Gradient

But instead of the sudden changes we modeled above, the cells swim from a low concentration place to a high concentration place.

We've simulated that, when traveling up the gradient, the cells demonstrated a decrease in tumbling frequency until all receptors are saturated. Then the tumbling frequency is restored to the original, by a balance of incrased ligand-receptor binding, and increased methylation states.

But what will happen if the ligands are then removed?
 - How would tumbling frequency change?
 - How would methylation states change?
