## The need for robustness in biological oscillators

* Nothing offers a better example of the need for *robustness* more than biological oscillators. For example, if something disrupts your heart rhythm, whether it be a lightning strike or a palpitation, there should be some process that allows it to return to oscillating as it did before.

* We see this in your circadian clock with jet lag. There is no clear reason why a human should have become evolved to fly halfway around the world and be so resilient to this that they can return to a normal daily cycle within a few days.

* The question, then, is whether the repressilator is robust; in other words, if we disturb this oscillator by suddently changing the concentrations of particles, will the system be able to eventually return to its oscillations?  And how long will it take to respond?  We will explore

* NOAH: please link to a second oscillator tutorial that walks the user through the disturbances that we apply.

## The repressilator is robust to disturbance

* The figure below illustrates that even with significant attempts to disrupt the number of particles in a system, the system returns to its oscillations within just a few cycles.

* NOAH: insert figure here.

* Robustness is a vital component of testing models of biological systems that need to be resilient to noise in order to ensure the stability of an organism's life processes.

* There is a bigger picture moral at hand, which is that if a biological system is robust, then we should be wary of trusting a fragile model of that system.

* In the next chapter, we will transition to a model of a bacterial cell's response to its environment that will involve more than three particles and require us to take into account many different reactions than we have in this section. A critical aspect of this model will be that it is robust.

* Yet before we get ahead of ourselves, there is one more point to be made about the models we have built in this module, which we will make in the module's conclusion.
