*Intro*

* Item one, but does the quantity of text do anything? Does it get annoyed if there are lots of words within a single list item? 
* Item two
* Item three
* We know from quantum physics that everything that happens in the universe is as a result of the interactions of particles, and that much of the movement of these particles boils down to randomness.
* It is difficult for "macro"-oriented beings like ourselves to even acknowledge that every hope we have ever had, every decision we have ever made, is the result of firings of neurons and the exchange of ions deep within us.
* So, although this is a course in biological modeling, much will revolve around our ability to make conclusions about large-scale things that we observe as a result of the complicated symphony of particles that are interacting randomly.
