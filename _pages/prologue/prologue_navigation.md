This section will provide images and descriptions for any part of the Blender window referenced in the rest of the module.

### CellBlender Layout

When a new file has been created, the following shows the menu options available: 

![image-center](../assets/images/motifs_nav1.png){: .align-center}

A. This is the window for modules like CellBlender. To start CellBlender, you must click on the “CellBlender” tab and then click the “Initialize CellBlender” button as shown in the image. This will then display the image shown in “D” 

B. There are many “View” tabs throughout the Blender window. When referring to the “View” tab in future tutorials,  this is the one which will be referenced. 

C. This window contains many options relating to a selected object. 

![image-center](../assets/images/motifs_nav2.png){: .align-center}

D. This is the CellBlender menu, which contains sub-menus which will be noted as follows: CellBlender > Model Objects. It is recommended that the edge of the window is dragged outward to increase visibility (see box “e” on the image)
