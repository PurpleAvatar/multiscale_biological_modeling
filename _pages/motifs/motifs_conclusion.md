## Learning objectives

1. What are motifs?
2. How does the common motif "negative autoregulation" work?
3. How can the motif "feed forward loop" change a cellular response?
4. How can a cell achieve oscillatory behaviors and how robust is this process?

* We also need a note at end of chapter about the fact that the cell is growing so that in more robust models the concentration is constantly decreasing as a result of the cell growing since it needs to double its volume every cell cycle.
