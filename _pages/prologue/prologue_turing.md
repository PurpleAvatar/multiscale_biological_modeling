* Brief background on Alan Turing – code breaker in WWII.  But is more famous for his study of how simple rules could extend to emergent behavior in large scale systems.
* In particular, he was able to demonstrate that every action a computer takes can be mimicked by a simple machine that reads and prints symbols to an infinitely long tape of cells.
* Almost 100 years after his work, no one has ever built a computer that is more sophisticated than this “Turing machine”.
* Shortly before his untimely demise, Turing wrote a single paper on biochemistry, which covered a very “macro” biological question: “Why do zebras have stripes?”
* Turing’s paper offers an excellent example for our prologue because it exemplifies how the interaction of particles can extend to a pattern that we observe at a much higher level, which in this case are patterns on an animal’s skin.
