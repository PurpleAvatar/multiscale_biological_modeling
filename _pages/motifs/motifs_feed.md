* The previous section works if we have a transcription factor, but a normal gene is not a transcription factor and therefore is not able to negatively autoregulate.

* The question is how a protein that is not a transcription factor could reach a steady-state concentration faster than with simple regulation, since it can't negatively autoregulate.



* The question is how we can mimic the feedback process that we saw in the previous section to facilitate a speedup over simple regulation of *X* by *Y* in the case that *Y* is not a transcription factor.
