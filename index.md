## Welcome to our course!

Have you ever wondered how your cells can react to their environment and perform complex tasks without any intelligence guiding them? Have you ever wondered what process causes zebras to have stripes?  Have you wondered why the original SARS coronavirus did not become a pandemic in 2003 but SARS-CoV-2 has spread like wildfire through the population?

We will see how each of these questions can be answered by biological modeling.

Welcome to our free and open course in multiscale biological modeling.

That may seem like a mouthful. By "biological modeling" we mean that we are going to build  models of biological systems that are relatively simple but nevertheless provide us with some deep insights into how those systems operate.

Furthermore, we will perform modeling of molecular and cellular biological systems at multiple "scales" of resolution, from the study of a single protein molecule within a cell's cytoplasm, to observing the interaction of proteins molecules interacting with each other as a whole, to a much wider view that considers cells themselves interacting with each other.  There are fascinating insights lurking at all these levels of resolution, and the goal of this course is to help learners understand some approaches that lead us to these insights.

## Meet the team

This course was lovingly put together by a professor and a team of students in Carnegie Mellon University's [Computational Biology Department](http://cbd.cmu.edu).  You can meet us on our [Meet the Team](meet-the-team) page.
