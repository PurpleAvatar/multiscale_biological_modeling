* Structure prediction is very complicated. Template-based modeling is the most accurate method, but requires large computational power and time to refine and produce accurate models.
* Small changes in residues can have large effects on the protein. Three regions of one to four residues caused marked conformational differences between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 Spike.
* ProDy and VMD offers many tools to help analyze, assess, and compare protein structures.
