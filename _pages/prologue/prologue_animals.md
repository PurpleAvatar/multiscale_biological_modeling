Now, returning to the question of zebras.

* Turing’s amazing result is that given just two particles that are diffusing via random walks and interacting when they encounter each other, the macro patterns of the two particles will exhibit stripes or spots as the case may be.
* Let us take a look at an example of this model.
* We will have two types of particles; for reasons that will become clear soon, you may like to think of one of these particles as a predator, and the other as a prey.
* The prey are fed into the system at some rate, and the predators die out at some rate.
* Both predators and prey diffuse randomly, but prey diffuse twice as fast.
* The system has a single reaction of particles among each other: when two predators and a prey collide as the result of their walk, with some probability the prey particle disappears and is replaced by a new, third predator.
	* (Is this the best way to describe it?)
* Note that there are four different parameters that are important in the system:
	* The diffusion rates of predator and prey particles (we think of these as a single parameter since once the predator diffusion rate is set, the prey particle has a diffusion rate twice as high)
	* The “kill” rate of the predators
	* The “birth” rate of the prey
	* The rate at which, when two predators encounter a prey, the reaction happens in which the prey particle transforms into a predator.
* You can think of all these parameters as dials we can turn, seeing how the system changes on a macro level.
* For some parameters, the system is not particularly interesting.  For example, if the death rate of predators is too high, they may die out so quickly that only prey are left.

(INSERT VIDEO SHOWING PREY THRIVING AND PREDATORS DYING OUT. Indicate parameters.)

* If the feed rate of prey is too high, then the predators will always be able to find prey, and we will see an explosion in the number of predators.

(INSERT VIDEO, with parameters indicated)

* The interesting behavior lies in a “sweet spot”: values of the four parameters that produce interesting macro behavior when we examine the system at a macro level.

(INSERT 3-4 MERT VIDEOS, WITH CLEAR EXPLANATION OF PARAMETERS EACH TIME)

* This behavior is remarkable first and foremost because we can pick out so much organization from tens of thousands of tiny particles. But it also is amazing that the system is so fine-tuned, meaning that very slight changes in parameter values can lead to significant changes in the overall system, which in this case is a change between spots and stripes.
* In fact, later in the course, we will see an example of a biological system that is not fine-tuned, but rather robust: variation in the system does not lead to substantive changes in the ultimate behavior of the system.
* The emergence of patterns from such a simple model was Turing’s essential contribution in the 1950s, and one that has been borne out both by biological research, which has found a molecular basis for the two-particle model in the development of some organisms, as well as evidence that the system is fine-tuned.
* For example, note the following photos of two giant pufferfish.

(Phillip will insert picture.)

* These two fish are genetically very similar, but one has stripes and the other spots. What seems like an enormous change in the appearance of an organism can actually be attributable to a small change of parameters in a fine-tuned system that is powered solely by randomness.

(Phillip will insert Turing quote on the horse part being the hard part)
